☁️ Weather Analytics: Real-Time Weather, AQI & Forecast Dashboard

An interactive and visually rich Power BI dashboard designed to monitor real-time weather conditions, air quality index (AQI), and short-term forecasts across global cities—tailored for learners, analysts, and enthusiasts alike.

2. Description / Purpose


The Weather Analytics Dashboard is a dynamic Power BI report that integrates real-time weather and AQI data to provide a comprehensive view of atmospheric conditions across multiple cities. Built for educational and analytical purposes, this dashboard empowers users to track temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and forecast trends from a single interface.

3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following technologies and tools:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core data visualization platform used to build the report.

⚙️ Power Query (M Language) – Used for transforming and fetching real-time weather and AQI data through API calls.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures like average temperature, AQI categories, and conditional visuals.

🌐 WeatherAPI – Data source providing live weather and air quality metrics by location.

🧱 Data Modeling – Structured data tables (weather, forecast, AQI, locations) to ensure smooth filtering and cross-interaction.

📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .png for dashboard snapshots, and .mp4 for demo walk-throughs.

4. Data Source
Source: WeatherAPI.com – A robust and reliable API providing live and forecasted weather data.
Data includes:

City-wise live weather updates (temperature, wind, pressure, humidity)

Forecast for upcoming days

Air Quality Index (PM2.5, PM10, CO, etc.)

Location metadata (country, region, coordinates)

5. Features / Highlights

• Business Problem
Weather variability affects everything from travel planning to outdoor events, yet most dashboards focus only on a single metric or city.
Users often need to track multiple atmospheric parameters across cities in real-time—with insights into pollution levels and forecast trends—without switching platforms.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To build an easy-to-use and real-time interactive dashboard that:

Displays live weather updates by city

Shows AQI status and categories (e.g., Good, Poor)

Presents forecast trends for decision-making

Empowers users with filterable, customizable views

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
🧊 KPI Cards Panel (Top Section)

Current Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, and Wind Speed

AQI Status (e.g., Good / Moderate / Poor) based on PM2.5 levels

📍 City Selector (Slicer Panel)
Interactive filters let users select a city and country to update all visuals dynamically.

📈 Temperature & Forecast Trend (Line Chart)
Visualizes past and upcoming weather (min/max temperature) to help users spot warming or cooling trends.

🌫️ Air Quality Index Breakdown (Gauge / Bar Chart)
Real-time air quality insights broken down into pollutants (e.g., CO, O3, PM2.5, PM10).

💧 Humidity & Pressure Distribution (Donut/Bar Visual)
Easily track daily humidity and atmospheric pressure variation per selected city.

🗺️ Weather Condition by Region (Map Visual)
Map visual showing multiple city markers with weather info pop-ups for global comparison.

🧪 Conditional Formatting & DAX Logic
Dynamically changes color and iconography based on weather severity or AQI category.

• Business Impact & Insights
✅ Smart Travel Planning: Tourists and logistics teams can assess conditions in real-time for safer, more informed decisions.

🌐 Public Health Monitoring: View AQI and pollution spikes to identify health risk periods, useful for elderly or sensitive groups.

🧠 Learning Resource: A complete Power BI practice project for students learning APIs, DAX, and M integration.

📊 Freelance Portfolio Builder: Showcases end-to-end BI pipeline from API data fetching to polished dashboard UI.

🔍 Data Analysis Practice: Helps users understand patterns between humidity, temperature, and AQI levels.
